### Accessible Web-Based Music Application: rAdio ###

##### WHAT IS rAdio? #####

rAdio is an accessible web-based music application that has multiple accessible features including: playback navigation, HTML5/ARIA compliant, shortcut keys, large buttons, and large text.  It is accessible to both the blind and people with low vision.  It has all of the normal features of a normal music player including: track title, artist, album title, album art, and volume control. 

##### INSTRUCTIONS #####

Shortcut Keys:

	* space : play/pause
	* left : previous track
	* right : next track
	* up : increase volume
	* down : decrease volume
	* f : seek foreward 10 seconds
	* d : seek backward 10 seconds	

##### WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES rAdio UTILIZE? #####

rAdio utilizes JQuery, JavaScript, and the RDIO API. [RDIO API](http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/Web_Playback_API) The Rdio player API allows rAdio to incorporate the playback of licensed Rdio music.  Rdio provides a jQuery library which simplifies embedding and interacting with the Web Playback SWF. JavaScript handles all of the events on the player.

##### WHAT CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE RDIO PLAYER #####
  
The RDIO player has shortcut keys for play/pause, previous, next, and playlist.  However, it does not have shortcut keys for volume control or seek functions.   
 
##### HOW DO THE SHORTCUT KEYS WORK? #####
JavaScript recognizes which key was pressed. Each shortcut key is then associated with a function of the player.
