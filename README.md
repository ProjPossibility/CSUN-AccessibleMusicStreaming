### Accessible Web-Based Music Application: rAdio ###

  ##### WHAT IS rAdio? #####

rAdio is an accessible web-based music application that has multiple accessible features including: playback navigation, 
HTML5/ARIA compliant, shortcut keys, large buttons, and large text.  It is accessible to both the 
blind and people with low vision.  It has all of the normal features of a normal music player including: track title, 
artist, album title, album art, and volume control. 

##### WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES rAdio UTILIZE? #####

rAdio utilizes JQuery, JavaScript, and the RDIO API.  
RDIO API <http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/Web_Playback_API>
The Rdio player API allows rAdio to incorporate the playback of licensed Rdio music.  Rdio provides a jQuery library 
which simplifies embedding and interacting with the Web Playback SWF. JavaScript handles all of the events on the player.

##### HOW DOES THE PLAYBACK NAVAGATION WORK? #####
  
 
##### HOW DO THE SHORTCUT KEYS WORK? #####
  JavaScript recognizes which key was pressed. Each shortcut key is then associated with a function.
