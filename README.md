# Project Possibility: SS12 Competition #
### Accessible Web-Based Music Application: rAdio ###

##### GOALS #####

rADIO goals can be found [here](https://github.com/ProjPossibility/CSUN-AccessibleMusicStreaming/wiki/SS12:-Project-Possibility-rAdio-Goals).

##### WHAT IS rAdio? #####

rAdio is an accessible web-based music application that has multiple accessible features including: playback navigation, HTML5/ARIA compliance, shortcut keys, large buttons, and large text.  It is accessible to both the blind and vision impaired.  It also has all of the normal features and design of a non-accesible player.  

##### INSTRUCTIONS #####

Shortcut Keys:
Press the following keys on your keyboard to perform their associated rAdio player funtion.

	* space : play/pause
	* left  : previous track
	* right : next track
	* up    : increase volume
	* down  : decrease volume
	* f     : seek foreward 10 seconds
	* d     : seek backward 10 seconds	

##### WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DOES rAdio UTILIZE? #####

rAdio utilizes JQuery, JavaScript, and the RDIO API. [RDIO API](http://developer.rdio.com/docs/read/Web_Playback_API) The Rdio player API allows rAdio to incorporate the playback of licensed Rdio music.  Rdio provides a jQuery library which simplifies embedding and interacting with the Web Playback SWF. JavaScript handles all of the events on the player.

##### WHAT CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE RDIO PLAYER #####
  
The RDIO player has shortcut keys for play/pause, previous, next, and playlist.  However, it does not have shortcut keys for volume control or seek functions.  The RDIO player is not Aria Compliant, and the screan reader could not easily read it.    
We created the user friendly rAdio interface and its unique design.
