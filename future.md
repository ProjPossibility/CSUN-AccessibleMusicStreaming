#**SS12: Project Possibility - Accessible Web Based Music Player** 
##**Future Features**

### Playlist
rAdio will feature a playlist section where the user's pre-made playlists from RDIO will appear.  Since RDIO authenticates the user, the user will have to build their playlists using RDIO.  rAdio
will utilize the same accessibility features on the playlist as it does on the rest of the application (shortcuts, HTML5/Aria compliance, etc.).

### Social Networking
rAdio will have a Social Networking feature which will allow the user create their own profile which will have their basic information (name, profile picture, etc.) and their playlists.

### Repeat and Shuffle
rAdio will have a repeat option which will repeat the current song until repeat is unchecked.  rAdio will also have a s shuffle option which que songs to play at random.

### Cleaner Design
The current rAdio design, is good, but not great.  It will still have the light wood background (which emulates having a radio on your desk), but the color scheme of the playerwill be more pleasing.
